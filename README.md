# Reinforcement-Learning (Q-Learning Grid World)
The people scared from ai because some day it can do such things like terminator concept in actual world by this RL (Reinforcement Learning).

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of **Q-Learning** for solving a Grid World problem using **Reinforcement Learning**. The agent learns to navigate the grid, maximize rewards, and reach the goal efficiently through an iterative learning process.

## Reinforcement Learning 
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. Through trial and error, it maximizes rewards by discovering the best strategies to achieve a goal. RL powers applications like robotics, game AI, self-driving cars, and more!

## What is Q-Learning?
Q-Learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm used to find the optimal action-selection policy. It follows the Bellman equation to update its Q-values based on the rewards received.

The core update rule in Q-learning is:

>𝑄( 𝑠 , 𝑎 ) ← 𝑄( 𝑠 , 𝑎 ) + 𝛼 [ 𝑟 + 𝛾 max 𝑎′ 𝑄(𝑠′,𝑎′) − 𝑄(𝑠,𝑎)]

 
Explanation of Terms:

>𝑄(𝑠,𝑎) → The current Q-value for state 𝑠 and action 𝑎.

>𝛼 (learning rate) → Controls how much new information influences the existing Q-value.

>𝑟 → The reward received after taking action 𝑎.

>𝛾 (discount factor) → Determines the importance of future rewards. A value close to 1 prioritizes long-term rewards, while a value close to 0 prioritizes immediate rewards.

>max <sub>𝑎′</sub>𝑄(𝑠′,𝑎′) → The highest estimated Q-value for the next state 𝑠′, considering all possible actions 𝑎′.

This equation allows the agent to learn an optimal policy by adjusting Q-values based on rewards and future estimations.
