# Reinforcement-Learning (Q-Learning Grid World)
The people scared from ai because some day it can do terminator concept in actual world by this RL (Reinforcement Learning).

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of **Q-Learning** for solving a Grid World problem using **Reinforcement Learning**. The agent learns to navigate the grid, maximize rewards, and reach the goal efficiently through an iterative learning process.

## What is Q-Learning?
Q-Learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm used to find the optimal action-selection policy. It follows the Bellman equation to update its Q-values based on the rewards received.

The core update rule is:
\[ Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha [r + \gamma \max Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)] \]
Where:
- \( Q(s, a) \) is the current Q-value for state \( s \) and action \( a \).
- \( \alpha \) is the learning rate.
- \( r \) is the reward received after taking action \( a \).
- \( \gamma \) is the discount factor.
- \( \max Q(s', a') \) is the estimated best Q-value for the next state.

## Features
- Implementation of **Q-Learning** in a grid environment.
- Visualization of agent's learning progress.
- Dynamic updates to Q-table.
- Exploration vs. Exploitation using **epsilon-greedy strategy**.

## Requirements
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Q_Learning_Grid
   cd Q_Learning_Grid
   ```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Q_learning_grid_.ipynb
   ```
3. Step through the notebook to train and visualize the Q-learning process.

## Results
- The agent learns the optimal path over multiple episodes.
- The Q-table gets updated dynamically, leading to better decision-making.
- A visualization is provided to observe the agent's learning progress.

## Future Improvements
- Implement **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)** for more complex environments.
- Test with **different grid sizes and obstacles**.
- Tune hyperparameters for optimal learning.
